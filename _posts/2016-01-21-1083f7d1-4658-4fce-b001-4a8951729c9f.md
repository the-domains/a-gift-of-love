Medicine comes to English from the Latin, "medicina" and refers to the art practiced by the "medicus" or physician. The Latin word itself may well derive originally from the root "media" referring to a middle way, or balance, since in classical Greek medicine (that which was known and practiced in the Roman world) health was a matter of balance, and disease was understood as an imbalance of the body. This balance could be restored by a "medicus" who would use herbs or prepared drugs to do so.

Our bodies speak to us on many levels, from physical symptoms to emotional and mental symptoms of imbalance.  One of the original tasks of the physician or healer is to decipher these messages and work with the body on all levels to restore balance.

****

The science of "treating" symptoms in what I will refer to as Western Medicine takes the path of listening to compartmentalized sections of the body's messages, and providing relief and comfort from the physical messages being communicated.  At times this system will suppress the symptoms, and completely ignore the origin.  

****

Eastern Medicine tends to look at the body with the knowledge that each system must be in balance, to work towards supporting the whole body.  Environment, emotions, and mental state are included in the diagnosis.  This style of medicine works more towards preventative health, and supporting the body's own immune system to heal itself with the assistance of herbs, acupuncture, massage, diet and individually created health and wellness plans.

****

Both paths of medicine are brilliant in the science and discovery of how the body works.  Each seemingly coming from the opposite perspective, to interpret the bodies messages.  When they come together, we will have the benefit of a truly advanced health and wellness system.  Ideally, a team of medical professionals trained in both eastern and western techniques, supported by a complete holistic healing center will be available in the future.  

****

In our current system of medicine, you would have to see a physician who might send you to another specialist, an eastern practitioner with great knowledge of herbs and acupuncture, a holistic nutritionist, a chiropractor, a massage therapist, a reiki or energy healer, and an intuitive or empathic counselor to address all of the concerns involved in the body being out of balance.  And the great need for these practitioners to communicate with one another about your individual case almost requires them to be under one building, working together.  We would like to see these healing centers throughout the world, available to all.

****

Balanced health and well being is contingent on the state of body mind and spirit.  Thought affects our health just as much if not more than diet and exercise.  Disease in the body is present in the energetic field before it manifest in the physical body.  

****

True health is attainable when all of the system is seen as and supported as a whole.

[Abraham-Hicks(tm)][0]

When doctors and scientists try to find cures for diseases without taking into consideration the Vibrational relationship between the physical Being and Source Energy, they are looking for cures in all the wrong places. If the resistance that disallowed the Well-Being to begin with is not released, it will show up in the form of another and another disease. Your cells, because of their connection to the intelligence of Source Energy, know exactly what to do in order to become the incredible variety of functioning cells in your magnificent physical body. And in the absence of the hindrance that is caused by your resistant negative thought, that communication stays open to clear, up-to-the-moment interaction, keeping your physical body at peak and perfect performance.

****

I envision healing centers spread over vast areas incorporating all aspects of medicine and healing, a working synergy on all levels of being.
