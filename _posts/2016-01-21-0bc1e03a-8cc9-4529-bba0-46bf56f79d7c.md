The Body.

It is my intention to spread light upon subjects which vary from what I originally was taught.

****

Please let me simplify;  calories = energy.  Yet what is the vibration of your energy intake?  Is it in tune with your body and your needs?

****

Calories to a number of people, have become a word equivalent to sin, and the spending of, or retribution for intake, is a punishment to ones own mind...when though about in a negative way.

****

The elements in food that have been studied and named based on their nutritional values were part of the original whole.  We speak in terms of calories, fats, carbohydrates, sugars and then on to vitamins and nutrients. I believe there is something else that we do not have a name for yet.  A life force in fresh foods still growing in the earth.  Something that slowly fades as it is picked from the tree or pulled from the ground. And we have no popular measurement for it yet, as it exists on a quantum energetic level.

****

_It is my opinion that another word for this energy, more inclusive than calorie,  be used in the future for the sake of clarity.  A peach that has been canned or jarred may have the same calories as a fresh peach picked from a tree, yet the life force levels are very different._

****

In essence, we are all solar powered.  As the sun reacts with the plants and trees  through the soil of the earth, energy is transmuted into the plant in it's entirety.  We then take it in by eating or drinking it, or as a secondary source through consuming the animal that originally ate the fruit, vegetable, or grain.

****

So if we are focusing on where the energy comes from, we can understand that in it's natural state, is the harmonious balance of what our bodies need.

****

I believe because of the need to prepare food and keep it longer for storage and transporting, we have moved past a healthy way of doing things a little, and need to readjust.  I also do not believe this is any ones fault.   Only a normal evolution in a learning cycle.  Yet now that we know there is a difference, it is our responsibility to fix it, without placing blame.  Everyone together.

****

In essence, this means the fresher the food source, with the least amount of processing the better.  Also to take into account the balance in the environment where the food is grown. Pesticides, over farming, unclean water, GMO's, pollution and the general state of the surroundings all affect the potential of what grows.
