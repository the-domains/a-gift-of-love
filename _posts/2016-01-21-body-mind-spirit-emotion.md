First I would like to introduce a Zen philosophy that allows us to look at information beyond duality.  That new ideas and old ideas can exist together without one being right, and the other wrong.  Perhaps more like pieces of a puzzle that fit together.

****

The foundation concept I wish to express here is that there is a deep interwoven relationship between the previously known and possibly _unknown_ areas we focus on concerning health and wellness.****

# BODY  MIND SPIRIT EMOTION

****

These are not separate from one another.  They are One.  Each needing it's own nourishment  and constantly seeking balance.  

****

They all seemingly exist on different levels, yet intertwined enough so that modern science is reaching beyond boundaries daily in new discoveries.  

String Theory, Quantum Mechanics and Shamanism all exist on a similar plane in the new world of information we are exploring.  Everything is Light and Sound.  Ancient texts are becoming clearer, and what we think we knew just expanded enough to ask for a redefinition.

****

While existing in a harmonious dance, the body, mind, emotions and spirit all have unique needs.
