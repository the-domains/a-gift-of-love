Alkaline Ash Foods

****

It is recommended that our diets consist of 80% alkaline ash foods.  These foods leave an alkaline ash as the body burns them for fuel.

****

There are two categories of Acid Ash foods - one slightly better.  It is recommended that our diets consist of 20% of these foods.  These foods leave an acid-ash when our bodies burn them for fuel.

Every cell in the body generates an electric field, and it needs a good oxygen level to convert glucose into energy.  Also the right Potassium to Sodium level to function properly.  The recommended ratio of Potassium to Sodium is 4/1, and you will find this in natural unprocessed foods, fruits and vegetables.  Conversely in processed foods, you will mostly find the reverse ratio.  Our bodies require whole foods to function properly:

Vitamins, Minerals, Protein, Carbohydrates and Fat.

**Cutting any of these out to \*diet is actually negating the bodies needs.  Look for natural sources, unprocessed foods, organic if possible.**
